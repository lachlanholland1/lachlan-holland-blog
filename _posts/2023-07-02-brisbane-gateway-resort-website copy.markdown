I built the website for Brisbane Gateway Resort using React, NextJS and ExpressJS, view the website here: <a href="https://brisbanegateway.com.au/" target="_blank">brisbanegateway.com.au</a>. The website interfaces with the property management system API to dynamically display accommodation availability and pricing. By building and maintaining the website I learnt alot about frontend web development, React, building API's, and converting customers to sales.

I built the website for Brisbane Gateway Resort using React, NextJS and ExpressJS. The website interfaces with the property management system API to dynamically display accommodation availability and pricing. I learnt alot about frontend web development and React. I designed and built the website's user interface to be easy to use inorder to promote guest's to book online rather than over the phone or in person.

Over a couple of weeks Nav Pathak and I developed a small multi-stage recommendation system built using PyTorch trained on data sourced from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations">H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations Kaggle competition</a>. Inspiration from the series of blog post by Adrien Biarnes titled: <a href="https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/building-a-multi-stage-recommendation-system-part-1-1-95961ccf3dd8">Building a Multi-Stage Recommendation System</a>.
